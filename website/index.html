                <h2>Jeff Bezos</h2>
                <p>
                    Jeff Bezos founded e-commerce colossus Amazon in 1994 out of his garage in Seattle. He runs it as CEO and owns an 11.1% stake.
					Between March and April 2020, amid the pandemic, Amazon said it hired 175,000 additional workers.
					In April 2020, Bezos said he would give $100 million to Feed America, a nonprofit that operates food banks and food pantries across the country.
					Amazon has faced criticism from U.S. senators and the general public for its treatment of warehouse workers during the 	coronavirus pandemic.

                <h2>Bill Gates</h2>
                <p>
                   With his wife Melinda, Bill Gates chairs the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the world's largest private charitable foundation.
				   In May 2020, the Gates Foundation said it would spend $300 million to fight the coronavirus pandemic, funding treatment, detection and vaccines.
				   Gates has sold or given away much of his stake in Microsoft -- he owns just over 1% of shares -- and invested in a mix of stocks and other assets.
				   In mid-March 2020, Gates stepped down as a board member of Microsoft, the software firm he founded with Paul Allen (d. 2018) in 1975.
				   To date, Gates has donated $35.8 billion worth of Microsoft stock to the Gates Foundation.
